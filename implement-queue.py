'''
Understanding:
implement the following operations of a queue using stacks
    -push will push an element to the back of the queue
    -pop will remove the element from the front of the queue
    - peek getst the front element of the queue
    -empty returns true or false if it is empty

Planning:
-Instantiation is the Queueâ€™s storage object that will be used.
-push(val) is the way to add data to the Queue.
-pop() is the way to remove and return the front element in the Queue.
-peek() is the way to return the front element without removing it.
-empty() is the way to tell if a Queue is empty and contains any values.
